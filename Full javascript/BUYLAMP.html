    <p>An electronics shop sells red and blue lamps. A red lamp costs X rupees and a blue lamp costs Y rupees. Shifu is going to buy exactly N lamps from this shop. Find the minimum amount of money Shifu needs to pay such that at least K of the lamps bought
        are red. Each test case consists of a single line containing four space-separated integers N,K,X,Y. write a function that accepts N,K,X,Y as parameters and return minimum amount of money Shifu needs to pay such that at least K of the lamps bought
        are red</p>
